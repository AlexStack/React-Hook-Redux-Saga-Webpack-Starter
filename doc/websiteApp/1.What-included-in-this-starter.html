        What included?

    </h2> Lots of React required packages, such as react-router-dom, axios, redux, saga, hook, webpack ... You do not
    need
    install
    them again, use them directly in your code.
    Using webpack to export the compiled js file, tidy and clean and flexible.
    npm run dev will automatically open a local dev demo page which can detect js file changes and show the result
    immediately.
    There are some code examples for demo and reuse purpose. We can easy change them to fit our requirements.
